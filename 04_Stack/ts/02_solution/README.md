# Code kata template with TypeScript and Jest

This code kata template uses as language and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as test framework.

To run the test, run the command

```sh
npm run test
```

To run the test with a watcher, open the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p` and execute the command `Run Jest --watch`

Tests should be implemented in the directory `test` and the production code should be placed in directory `src`.
